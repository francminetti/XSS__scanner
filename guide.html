             <p class="text_guide"><br/><br/>This application was created with the aim of automating the discovery of XSS flaws in web applications(at least the simplest cases).
             The application can scan for reflected xss via GET form vulnerabilities.
             In order to function correctly, the URLs entered in the specific area must refer to pages where authentication is not required.
             For more info about the elaboration you can open the browser console, in this area will be visualized the following: </p>
             
             <ul class="description_guide">
                <li class="description_guide"> link within the injected Javascript </li>
                <li class="description_guide"> number of form analyzed during the scan </li>
                <li class="description_guide"> info about the success of the injection </li>
                <li class="description_guide"> info about times that the Javascript is reflected into the page analyzed </li>
             </ul>
             
            
            <p class="text_guide">The processing is synchronous and the end of the processing is expected for correct operation. 
            There are two modes of execution: simple and advanced.
            In the simple scan, an attempt is made to inject code through the correct form parameter.
            In advanced scanning an injection is attempted for all the parameters of the querystring, and an injection is also attempted
            encoded in hexadecimal and decimal, in all its possible forms.
            Once the processing is finished, all the URLs that are found to be vulnerable will appear in red, and by clicking on them you can consult
            the reports, which will contain information regarding which parameters are found to be vulnerable.
            All the URLs that turned out to be <b> not </b> vulnerable will appear in white.
